The first question is to print out the numbers in the range of 2000 and 3200(both are inclusive) which are divisible by 7 and not divisible by 5

I have used a for loop in the given range and in the if clause i have written if the number when divided by 7 gets a remainder 0 and when divided by 5 will not be zero.

I have appended all the values into a empty list which satisfies the given condition and printed the values by adding separater as (,).


The second question is to accept the users first name and last name and we need to print the first name and last name in reverse order seperated by a space

I have printed last name at first and then added a space and then printed the first name to acheive the correct output


The third question is to find out the volume of sphere with diameter 12 cm

I have used the formula of sphere to solve this and the formula is 4/3*pi*r*r*r and i have printed the result

Also i imported the pi from math package
